<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The purpose of the TreePeeps app is to support sustainability and reforestation through helping people bring together the land, time and funding necessary to create small to medium forested areas. The core functionality of the app is to allow people to post one of three resources to other users: land available for planting trees, the time and energy needed to actually plant trees and the trees themselves or financial support to purchase them, on whatever scale is appropriate.
In addition, the app should provide a means of tracking and/or monitoring projects and trees. The app should be able to flag tree-planting sites through use of the What3Words app, or something similar. Progress of sites can then be tracked through user-posted blogs and images.
App Details
The App will allow users to post requests for land, trees or other resources, or volunteers, with which to plant trees and to respond to the posts of others.
·        Some users will post their willingness to give time and assist in planting.
·        Some users will post land they have available on which to plant trees.
·        Some users will post a willingness to contribute resources towards the planting of trees. We do not envisage money changing hands and will write both a disclaimer and a warning to this effect, but will rather encourage the purchase and contribution of physical resources.
·        The app will allow users to contact like-minded people and facilitate trees being planted.
·        Additional functionality may include:
o   A blog in which to post success stories facilitated by the app, posting details of trees planted so far.
